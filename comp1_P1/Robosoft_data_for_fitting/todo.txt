NEED TO DO
1) Rotate and change the coordinate fram for all data - done
2) Use spline fitting for the data in 1) and convert them to meters- done
3) Store the above processed data which will be used for the fitting- done
4) Run the fitting with the spline fit data
    a) Test with previous formulation
    b) Test with current formulation
    c) Test with min max setup
    d) Computational time for each fitting in a) and b)\


SOME OTHER NOTES:
1) Take poissons ratio as 0.5 which is the case for silicone elastomers
 E = 2G(1+nu)
E = 3*G

J = 2I

So GJ = 2EI/3
2) K is positive and tau is negative for our experimental data

3) For 0_0 and 6_0 used a two degree spline fitting


NEW FORMULATION:
getParams3

I = I_z +
